## Laravel test and deployment web-app 

Laravel.kdapp is a simple custom web-app for [Koding.com](http://koding.com/).

I've built this to make Laravel beginners/testers life more easy. Just think
using Wordpress.com, but together with the builtin Terminal app,
[Koding.com](http://koding.com/) is a excellent way to work in the cloud
and learn new programming skills like (like Laravel)

# Features

- Easily create Laravel app with one click.
- Quick links to App and Artisan (with a link to remove it too)
- Perfectly for testing and learning Laravel

# How to use it?

1. Koding account is required (currently invite-only)
2. Copy it into the **Applications** folder
3. Open it via **New Tab**
